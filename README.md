# task_prioritization
Underlying logic for visibility preference to various tasks in the dapp feed.

The tasks on NEARN have differing priorities based on: 
1. Who posted them 
2. When they were posted
3. Genre of the task
4. Skill level of the task 
5. Duration of the task
6. Current Saturation of the genre
7. Amount involved

Based on these, a task may get more or less visibility on the feed in terms of 'total impressions per hour per cluster'. However, every task will eventually be visible to everyone.
